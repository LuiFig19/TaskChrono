Role: Frontend Engineer (React + Next.js + Tailwind + Drag-and-Drop Interactions)

Goal:
Fix the drag-and-drop lag issue for widgets in light mode on the dashboard.
The dark mode drag-and-drop system works perfectly â€” smooth and responsive â€” but in light mode the dragging is noticeably slow or jittery.
You must make the light mode use the same drag-and-drop performance and logic that dark mode uses, without affecting visuals, layout, or any other functionality.

ðŸ§© Instructions

Locate the component handling dashboard widget drag-and-drop logic (likely using libraries such as react-beautiful-dnd, dnd-kit, or a custom handler).

Identify where theme-specific conditions are applied (for example, if (theme === "light") or CSS conditions based on light mode).

Compare how drag events are initialized and updated in dark mode versus light mode â€” the event handlers, state updates, and transform styles should be identical.

Ensure the same animation timing, transform, and hardware acceleration (translate3d, will-change: transform, etc.) are used for both modes.

If separate logic blocks exist for each theme, refactor so both use the same handler functions for:

onDragStart

onDragUpdate

onDragEnd

Check CSS or Tailwind conditional classes â€” make sure light mode doesnâ€™t override positioning or transitions that cause lag (e.g. background or opacity transitions during drag).

Verify that this fix only applies to light mode performance, without changing:

UI colors

shadows

layout spacing

border radius or animations

After changes, test thoroughly:

In dark mode â†’ drag-and-drop remains smooth

In light mode â†’ drag speed and response match dark mode exactly

ðŸ’¡ Constraints

Do not edit unrelated UI or theme logic.

Do not push to GitHub or deploy â€” this fix is local only for testing.

Keep the same theme toggle and persistence behavior.

Focus purely on performance parity between light and dark mode drag behavior.

âœ… Expected Outcome

After completion:

Both dark and light modes share identical drag-and-drop logic and smooth animation timing.

Light mode widget dragging no longer lags or slows down.

The siteâ€™s layout, design, and theme visuals remain unchanged.
